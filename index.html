        <h3><i>Interesting Facts About iguanas</i></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Iguanas during the times of attack; use their tails to punch the enemy. Also, they can detach a part of their tail in danger and ensure a fast escape</li>
            <li>On the top of their heads; these lizards have a third eye, which is a retina-like structure that connects to the pineal gland in the brain</li>
            <li>Iguanas who can be very stable and safe in the trees can occasionally fall but what is interesting is that they can survive great falls even from the height of 40-50 feet and that too without any injuries</li>
